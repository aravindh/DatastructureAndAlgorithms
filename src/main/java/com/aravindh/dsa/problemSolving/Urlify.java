/**
 * Given a String, replace every space with %20.Assume that there is sufficient space at the end of the string.
 * Approach 1: O(n^2)
 *  Start iterating the characters from 0 to n, if we encounter a space replace it with %20 by shifting the rest of the characters.
 * Approach 2: O(n)
 *  Start iterating n down to 0, (because the bottleneck in approach 1 was shifting chars each time) if we encounter a space replace with %20 or else the same char.
